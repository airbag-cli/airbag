# Gemini Documentation

## Project Overview

This project appears to be a validation library, likely for parsing and validating data structures. It uses ANTLR for grammar definition and parsing, and provides a set of tools for validating the parsed data.

## The Importance of Documentation

Well-written and comprehensive documentation is crucial for any project. It serves as a guide for users, developers, and contributors, ensuring that the project is easy to understand, use, and build upon. Good documentation leads to:

*   **Faster onboarding:** New developers can get up to speed quickly.
*   **Increased adoption:** Users are more likely to adopt a project that is well-documented.
*   **Improved collaboration:** Clear documentation facilitates collaboration among team members.
*   **Reduced support load:** Users can find answers to their questions in the documentation, reducing the need for support.

## Build System

This project uses **Apache Maven** as its build system. Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on the concept of a Project Object Model (POM). The `pom.xml` file in the root of the project contains all the information about the project and its dependencies.

To build the project, you can use the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```
